# Lab3

We have masterCLK, masterToTimer, timer written in so far

masterCLK produces the different Hz

masterToTimer is a mux that takes the clks and puts out the Hz depending on ADJ and SEL

timer takes a clock and increments the time

TODO:

implement segDisp (should be easily done, input from timer)

implement scanning and blinking (I do not know how to do this yet)

implement the pause function (I do not know how to do this yet)

implement the SEL cases in timer, shouldn't be hard

figure out how the pins work in relation to UCF
